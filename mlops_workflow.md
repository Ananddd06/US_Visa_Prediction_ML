# **Project Workflow Guide**

## **Step 1: Initial Setup**
To begin the project, follow these steps to create a strong foundation:

1. **Initialize a Git Repository**  
   - Create a Git repository to track changes and maintain version control.
   - Commit all initial files to keep your workflow organized.

2. **Core Files to Add**
   - **`requirements.txt`**: List all the dependencies and libraries required for the project.  
   - **`setup.py`**: Contains the setup script for installing dependencies and configuring the project.  
   - **`README.md`**: A markdown file (this one) providing an overview of the project, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.

3. **Automating Directory and File Creation**
   - Use a **template file** to define the directory structure and files needed for the project.
   - Iterate over the list of directories and files using a loop:
     - Split the directory and file names with `os.path.split(data_dir, datafile)`.
     - Use `os.mkdir()` to create directories.
     - Check if the file exists:
       - If it exists, open it using `with open(file_name, "w") as f`.
       - If it doesnâ€™t exist, create it.

## **Step 2: Setup Script**
Create a file named **`setup.py`** to handle package installation and project setup.

1. **Package Installation**
   - Write a function to install all dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

2. **Setup Function**
   - Include key details such as:
     - Author name  
     - Author email  
     - Project name  
   - Call the function to install the required packages.

## **Step 3: Exception Handling and Logging**
Robust error handling and logging are essential for a reliable workflow.

1. **Exception Handling**
   - Handle exceptions for:
     - Missing files: Raise a `FileNotFoundError` if a specified file is not found.  
     - Missing directories: Raise an appropriate error if directories are not found or accessible.

2. **Logging**
   - Implement a logging system to:
     - Track the workflow.
     - Log timestamps and actions for better traceability.
   - Use log files to debug issues efficiently.

## **Step 4: Data Exploration and Model Building**
Create a folder named **`Notebook`** for all analysis and modeling tasks. This will include:

1. **Attach the Dataset**
   - Include the `.csv` file for the project.  

2. **Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Understand the dataset structure and uncover insights.  

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Engineer new features to improve model performance.

4. **Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Train models and tune hyperparameters to achieve the best results.
